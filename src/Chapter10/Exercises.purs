module Chapter10.Exercises where

import Prelude

-- forall a.a is a value

-- forall a. a -> a -> a is:
-- (x) => {return (x1)=> {x  (or it could be x1)} }  (this is the first/ second function)

-- forall a. Ord a => Array a -> Boolean
-- This function creates a tuples function that looks up in a typeclass dictionary. But there are
-- several valid implementations, although "sorted" is the most likely
